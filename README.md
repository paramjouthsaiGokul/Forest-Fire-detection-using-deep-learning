# Week-1-Assignment
Developed a machine learning model to detect forest fires using deep learning techniques. The project focused on building an early warning system to identify forest fires from satellite or sensor data. The system leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification to distinguish between forest fire zones and safe areas.
